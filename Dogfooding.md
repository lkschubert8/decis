### Question "roll"
- What should these data structures look like?

### Option "angle"
- Question : roll
- Right now I seem to like the idea of Questions, Groups
of options linked to question by ref and Decisions that are
linked to said question

### Decision "neck"
- Question : roll
- SelectedOption : angle
- Rationale : It's the only option I have so far and
I want to get coding it! I did forget about context,
I'm not sure if that should be linked to the question
itself or specific options? New Question!

### Question "persuade"
- When coming up with decision neck, the question came
up of what gets contextual information?

### Option "already"
- Question persuade
- I'm leaning towards only a question can really have context, where as a decision
will have the why.
